# xchainClient

The xchainClient provides a set of tools to facilitate [cross-chain data bridge](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts) from any blockchain to Filecoin network. It includes utilities for managing Ethereum accounts, submitting offers, and handling Filecoin deal process.


## üöÄ Installation

Ensure you have **Go** installed. Then, clone the repository and build the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/xchainClient.git
cd xchainClient
go build -o xchainClient ./cmd/xchain.go
```

### üìå Configure Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env` file to store your **XCHAIN_PASSPHRASE** (used for unlocking the keystore to interact with Ethereum compatbile chains):
    ```sh
    echo "export XCHAIN_PASSPHRASE=your_secure_password" > .env
    ```

2. **Source the file** to load the variable into your environment before you run any xchainClient commands:
   ```sh
   source .env
   ```

3. Verify that the variable is set:
   ```sh
   echo $XCHAIN_PASSPHRASE
   ```

### üîë **Generating an Ethereum Account**

A new command, `generate-account`, allows you to create an Ethereum keystore account and store it at a **specific file path**.

```sh
./xchainClient generate-account --keystore-file ./config/xchain_key.json --password "$XCHAIN_PASSPHRASE"

```

**Example Output**
```
New Ethereum account created!
Address: 0x123456789abcdef...
Keystore File Path: /home/user/onramp-contracts/xchain_key.json
```

üîπ This saves the keystore file **at the exact location specified**. The file is **password-protected** and should be stored securely.

üîπ To enable xChainClient to interact with both the source and destination chains (Filecoin in this case), you need to acquire test tokens for your wallet address on each chain's testnet to cover transaction fees.

- Filecoin calibration faucets: you can find [here](https://docs.filecoin.io/networks/calibration#resources). 
- other L1 which you build your application on. 

### üõ† **config.json**
To run xchainClient for your preference, we will need to update `config.json` with your preferred params. 

For example:
- chain config & contracts addresses deployed on that chain.
- ClientAddr & PayoutAddr: to pay tx fee and receive payment from Client
- OnRampABIPath: copy compiled onramp ABI into this path.
- MinDealSize & TargetAggSize
- DealDelayEpochs & DealDuration

üëâ Refer to [Configuration section](#config-file-configjson) for more details.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Daemon

Once you have finisehd the above process and sucessfully deployed [onramp contracts](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts) to the source chain and Filecoin. You should update the `config.json` with the correct information.

To start the Xchain adapter daemon, run:

```sh
./xchainClient daemon --config ./config/config.json --chain avalanche --buffer-service --aggregation-service
```

## Usages
### üì° **offering data with automatic car processing**

the `offer-file` command simplifies offering data by automatically:

1. converting the file into a car format.
2. calculating the commp (content identifier for proofs).
3. uploading the car file to a local buffer service.
4. submitting an offer transaction to the blockchain.

```sh
./xchainclient client offer-file --chain avalanche --config ./config/config.json <file_path> <payment-addr> <payment-amount>
```

Example:

```sh
./xchainclient client offer-file --chain avalanche ./data/sample.txt 0x5c31e78f3f7329769734f5ff1ac7e22c243e817e 1000
```

### üì° **submitting an offer (manual method)**

to submit an offer to the onramp contract manually:

```sh
./xchainclient client offer <commp> <size> <cid> <bufferlocation> <token-hex> <token-amount>
```

Example:

```sh
./xchainclient client offer bafkreihdwdcef4n... 128 /data/file1 /buffers/ 0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f 1000
```

### üîç **Checking Deal Status**

To check the deal status for a CID:

```sh
./xchainClient client dealStatus <cid> <offerId>
```

Example:
```sh
./xchainClient client dealStatus bafkreihdwdcef4n 42
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### **Config File (`config.json`)**
The Xchain Client uses a `config.json` file to store its settings. The configuration file should be placed inside the `config/` directory.

**Example `config.json`**
```json
{
  "destination": {
    "ChainID": 314159,
    "LotusAPI": "https://api.calibration.node.glif.io",
    "ProverAddr": "0x61F0ACE5ad40466Eb43141fa56Cf87758b6ffbA8"
  },

### **Multi-Chain Support**
Xchain Client supports interaction with multiple blockchains. Users can configure multiple `sources` to enable cross-chain deal submissions. Supported networks include:
- **Filecoin**
- **Avalanche**
- **Polygon**

Each source requires an **API endpoint** and an **OnRamp contract address**, which are specified under the `sources` field in `config.json`.

## üìñ **Additional Notes**
- **Keep your `config.json` file secure** since it contains sensitive information like private key paths and authentication tokens.
- **Use strong passwords** when generating Ethereum accounts.
- **Regularly back up keystore files** to avoid losing access to funds.

## üí° Troubleshooting
**Error: "config.json not found"**

Ensure the config file is correctly placed in the `config/` directory and named `config.json`.

**Error: "invalid keystore file"**

Ensure the keystore file is correctly generated using `generate-account` and that you are using the correct password.

**Error: "failed to connect to API"**

Check that your `Api` field in `config.json` is correctly set to a working Ethereum/Web3 provider.
